# TripMates
TripMates is an innovative platform that connects like-minded travelers for group trips, matching them based on shared interests and preferences. Users begin by completing a detailed survey on their personality and travel habits, specifying if they smoke, drink, enjoy partying, or prefer activities like trekking, camping, and sightseeing. They can also choose the type of group they want to join, such as all-male, all-female, or LGBTQ+ friendly.

Once registered, users can create or join travel groups that match their criteria. The platform includes a trip expense splitter, allowing members to manage and divide costs easily. A secure payment gateway ensures that all payments are completed before bookings are confirmed. Users can involve travel agents affiliated with the platform for assistance with bookings and travel arrangements, though this is not mandatory.

TripMates emphasizes safety and authenticity, requiring users to verify their identity through Aadhar details and a selfie that matches their Aadhar photo. This ensures that the community is trustworthy and reliable. A consent form is also signed before each trip to prioritize safety and mutual agreement among group members.

The website features a sleek, black-and-white design, providing a visually appealing and modern user experience. The responsive design ensures seamless access across all devices. The login page is designed to captivate users with an animation of shooting stars, setting a celestial tone for their journey. Additionally, the site includes an advertising footer, providing space for ads to generate revenue for the platform.

TripMates is the perfect platform for those exploring the world with people who share their interests and lifestyles. Whether youâ€™re into road trips, camping, or sophisticated sightseeing, TripMates makes it easy to find your next travel companions and create unforgettable experiences.
